Let's conclude the course with
some discussion on the roles that
hardware play in security and trust.
Assume that you have some valuables,
gold, diamonds, jewelry or whatever.
How to protect it?
Most of us will think,
put it in a safe and lock it.
In our discussion, hardware is the safe.
So, let's say, you have a digital
secret you want to protect.
You can develop a solid crypto-algorithm
with secure protocol to protect it.
And, you can write a, a solid,
a well-protected software to
implement this crypto-algorithm or
secure protocol.
But, eventually you need hardware.
You need computers to exe,
execute these software products.
You need developers to
do the communication.
So, this is the first role of
hardware plays in security and trust.
It is an enabler, without hardware we
cannot do all these computation of the,
and the communication.
And also, people know that
customized hardware always has
better performance than
software implementation.
So that brings us to the second
role of hardware in security and
trust, it becomes an enhancer.
Normally, enhance the performance
of the system in terms of speech,
energy consumption, et cetera.
And we have also seen
the case of security and
trust with additional
hardware inside the systems.
The system can add more
security to the system.
More recently,
we have seen more advance or
more involvemen,
involvement of hardware in security.
We present it by this thing
called Trusted Platform Module.
And also some,
a lot of this Vormetric uh,co-processors.
What they do there is they are trying
to build a first line of defense.
If you cannot pass the authentication
check in TPM, if you cannot pass
the authentication check by the biometric
co-processor, you cannot access the CPU.
And however, we have seen that it
is important to have hardware,
but if you don't design
your hardware properly.
Let's come back to this safe.
The safe is solid, however,
you leave the key combination of
the safe right on top of the safe.
Then this safe is not safe anymore.
This is the same as when you design
a hardware, you leave a lot of back doors.
And through the course, we have seen a lot
of vulnerabilities from hardware side.
People can use side-channel attacks.
People can use physical attacks.
Trying to steal the information
inside the hardware,
trying to attack the physical system.
This brings us to this, this question.
Is hardware become the weakest
link in security or not?
Unfortunately, if you don't
design your hardware properly,
if you don't think about security and
the trust to the design and
optimization of your hardware, it will
become the weakest link for security.
So what will be the challenges for
hardware design?
In my opinion, there are three
things we have to consider.
First, as a hardware designer,
you want to secure the design.
You want to protect your
intellectual property.
And we have discussed
about the attacks the,
the overbuilding, counterfeiting,
IP theft and IP misuse.
And we have already provide
count countermeasures or
techniques to prevent this,
like digital watermark,
digital fingerprint, hardware metering,
all these things of authentication.
And also you have to make sure that
the hardware you deliver to the customer,
they are trusted.
This is what we call the trusted
integrated circuits.
There shouldn't be any backdoors.
There shouldn't be any
hardware Trojan horse.
And the second challenge of
hardware design here is eventually,
the hardware is going
to do some computation.
It's going to have some data.
You want to make sure the data will be
secured, and against side channel attacks,
against any physical attacks to
any kind of memory or And finally,
you have to be active, trying to
provide hardware security primitives.
Try to enhance or improve the system's
overall security performance.
And we have talked about the TPM, and
they are also secure co-processors, which
speed up the competition of security.
And we have seen PUF.
We have seen random number generators.
This x can stand for t, for
true random number, true number, number,
random number generators, while p for
pseudo-random number generators.
And also, you have to keep,
always keep on looking at the new devices,
and the new technologies, and
whether it will bring any
vulnerabilities to the hardware design.
And, or, whether it can provide
new features for hardware design.
I hope that in the, in this six weeks,
you have learned something,
which might be useful, and it can be,
you can use it to protect your design,
to make your design more secure.
And finally, I will say, thank you
