Which takes financial increase
in the complexity and
the cost of building
a chip manufacturing line.
Most chip makers are fabless now.
In other words, today's design houses can
not afford the in-house chip fabrication
cost and that they have to outsource
this fabrication to foundries elsewhere.
This gives the foundries access to the
details of the chips and the possibility
of overbuilding them without the
authorization from the, the design house.
Integrated circuits metering, or
hardware metering, is an effective method
to defend against this IP infringement.
Integrated circuit metering is
a set of security protocols
that enable the design house to achieve
post-fabrication control over their ICs.
IC metering techniques are developed to
defend against IC overbuilding attacks.
As we have mentioned earlier, in the
integrated circuit fabrication process,
these houses and
foundries play asymmetric roles.
These houses have to disclose
the details of their IPs and
pay the cost to build the mask in order
to manufacture their, their chips.
Once the IP is released and
the mask is built, the design house
will not have any control on them.
However, a dishonest foundry can
utilize this information and
the facilities to reproduce
the design with negligible cost.
This is known as the IP overbuilding.
Can we use digital watermarking
techniques to protect a design,
designer's right in this case?
The answer is no.
Watermark protects the authorship
of an intellectual property.
In IC overbuilding,
the foundry just reproduce more
copies of the IP than required.
And then sells the extra
copies to make profit.
The foundry will not attempt to
claim the authorship of the IP.
How about digital fingerprint?
Fingerprint enables the trace of
intellectual properties back to
the dishonest IP user who
illegally distributed the IP.
When the overbuilt ICs
carry a fingerprint,
the user who has this fingerprint will
also become the victim of IC overbuilding.
This is because this
innocent user will be,
now be considered as the source
of these extra copies.
How integrated circuits metering or
hardware metering solves
this problem then.
Let's first see how meters
work in our daily life.
Why don't we talk about utility meters,
like water meter or electricity meter?
The meters are installed and
maintained by the utility
providers to monitor the users.
However, in the case of
the IC overbuilding,
the foundry is the provider of the ICs.
And the design house who receive
these ICs will be the user.
So what we need in, in our case
is actually a reverse metering.
Where the user wants to
monitor the provider.
The basic concept behind IC metering
is to enable a unique tag to each copy
of the IC and make sure that the tag is
under the control of the design house,
not the foundry.
Over the years, many different types
of tags have been proposed and used for
hardware metering.
They can be categorized
based on various criterias.
First, when the tag can only be used for
cheap identification,
it is called a passive metering.
The tag in active metering can also
do a lot of other functionalities,
such as enable the chip,
disable the chip, or control the chip.
Active metering methods can be further
classified as internal controlled or
external controlled based on whether
the control is part of the design or not.
Intrinsic metering does not need help
from additional hardware components,
or the modification of the design.
However, extrinsic metering methods do.
Depending whether the tag interacts
with the chip's functionality or
not, we have non-functional metering and
functional metering.
Finally, some tags can be reproduced and
some cannot.
We call the latter unclonable tags, tags.
Serial number is perhaps
the most popular and
one of the earliest of ways for
device tagging.
A serial number can be physically
indented on the device or
stored permanently in the memory.
This image shows a Trusted Platform Module
in storage on a motherboard.
What we see here is,
it has a couple of serial numbers.
For example here, and here.
These tags are passive, they are extrinsic
because they do need additional,
like this piece of paper or trying to be
physically indented on the, on the device.
And they are non-functional
because they have nothing to do
with the functionality of the chip, and
most important, they are reproducible.
You can use another tag or
piece of paper to over, to cover this.
Or you can change the numbers here.
And it, it is the fact that
this text can be reproduced
make them unsuitable to
countermeasure foundry overbuilding.
The ICID tag was proposed around 2007.
It is based on the silicon
manufacturer variation.
Because these variations occur
during the chip fabrication process,
and it is generally believed that
they are random and uncontrollable.
Therefore, ICID is considered
as an unclonable tag,
and thus can be used for
anti-overbuilding.
Depending whether the ID requires
additional hardware components or
not, IC Identification, or ICID, can be,
can be either intrinsic or extrinsic.
Let's first see an example of
an intrinsic unclonable ICID
based on leakage current.
Consider a small subcircuit with
four two-input NAND gate, G1,
G2, G3 and G4, with five input signals,
x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5.
So here is the leakage of our
ideal two-input NAND gate and
the different input combinations.
However, due to fabric,
fabrication variation, the leakage on
the NAND2 gates will almost for
sure be different from these ideal values.
For example,
let's consider two ICs both have this two,
have the structure of four
two-input NAND gates.
Their total leakage under four different
input vectors are listed here in
this table, and we see a dramatic
difference between their leakage values.
This leakage-based attack
is intrinsic because it
does not require any extra hardware.
It is also unclonable because it is
based on fabrication variations.
It is will be very hard for any foundries
to reproduce this manufactured variations.
Now we show a functional
passive tagging message.
Recall that in the graph vertex coloring
problem, we want to assign each node
a color such that any pair of adjacent
nodes will receive different colors.
In this case, the IP is a solution
to the graph coloring problem.
Consider this graph and
a coloring scheme, or an IP.
We observe that node H, for example,
can also be colored with red or yellow,
because it has only two neighbors and
they are both colored, colored with green.
And similarly, we observe that F can
also receive a color, which is brown.
And finally, node E can also be
colored by green instead of yellow.
So, therefore,
we can create 12 different tags by
giving different colors to
these three modes, H, E, and F.
This is a functional tag, because the tag,
which has the colors for node H, E, and F,
is part of the solution or
part of the functionality of the IP.
Next, we see active integrated
circuit metering methods.
Most of the existing active metering
methods follow the following steps.
First, the design house will
modify the design specification,
most likely in the early design stage,
to insert a lock.
Then complete the design and
ask the foundry to fabricate that design.
The foundry will fabricate, and
then, maybe, overbuild the chips.
Due to manufacturer variations, each chip
with each IC, will have a unique and
unclonable identifier that can be
used to authenticate the chip.
In the active IC metering scheme,
the design house can use this unique
ID to actively meter or monitor the IC.
For example, by enabling, disabling,
locking, or unlocking the ICs.
Here is an example of an internal
active IC metering approach.
The design house introduces
additional flip-flops to
build what is called a boosted
finite state machine.
Notice that each added flip-flop
will double the number of states in
the original finite state machine.
Therefore, when we power up the chip and
use the path data to select
a random power up state.
Most likely this state does not belong to
any of the original final state machine.
But for the chip to function properly, it
has to start from certain initial state.
The design house will provide a chip
with power up states specific input
sequence to direct the random power
up state to the initial state,
such that the chip can work properly.
Without this correct input sequence,
the, the,
the IC will not be, it will be useless.
This active IC metering approach
uses internal finite state machine
to control chips, to,
to control the monitoring of chip.
The additional flip-flops
make it extr extrinsic.
The use of PUF ensures
that it is unclonable and
thus can be used to countermeasure
chip overbuilding attack.
Finally, we show an external
active IC metering approach.
In this approach, the design house
will add control signals and
logical units such as exclusive or
gate to non-critical parts of the design.
Unless all the control signals
receive the proper values,
the chip or
the fabricated ICs will be locked.
The design house will then provide
an external key to unlock each of
the ICs based on some asymmetric
cryptographic primitives, for
example, the public key infrastructure.
In this case,
we see this is active metering scheme.
Because it does involve
the interaction between the,
the design house and each fabricated ICs.
It is an external method
because the signal comes from
the external value
provided by design house.
It is extrinsic because we do introduce
additional control signals and
logical gates.
And finally, it is also unclonable,
which means that it can also be used
to countermeasure circuit overbuilding.
