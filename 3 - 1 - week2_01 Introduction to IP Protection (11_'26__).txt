Welcome back to Hardware Security.
This week we will talk about
how hardware designers can
protect their design intellectual
properties from being misused.
We will learn what design
intellectual properties are and
why they are important in
modern hardware design.
We will show that in
addition to law enforcement,
there are several techniques available for
you to protect design intellectual,
intellectual properties by yourself.
These techniques include digital
watermarking, digital fingerprinting,
integrated circuit metering,
and design obfuscation.
So, the discussion of this
message we will also see how to
make the tradeoff amount, security,
cost, and system performance.
No special background is needed
to understand these concepts.
However, the examples we will use require
some basics of digital logic design.
We will also introduce the concept
of graph coloring problems and
graph partitioning problems.
How we use them?
According to the Cambridge
International Dictionary of English,
intellectual property is an original idea,
which can be used to earn money.
Original reflects the novelty
of the intellectual property and
that the phrase can be used implies the
usability of the intellectual property.
Examples of intellectual
properties are products,
technologies, softwares, and so on.
Meanwhile, it also states
that's the person or
group who is recognized as having
the idea can use the law to
prevent other people from
earning money by copying it.
This law enforcement includes, patents,
copyrights, trade secrets, and so on.
In VLSI design,
an intellectual property is a dig,
is a design unity that can
be reasonably viewed as
a stand-alone sub-components of
a complete system on-chip design.
It can be any innovation and
the technology that make designs better.
For example, a place design algorithm,
a power management technique,
or a noble design or testing method.
These are all considered as Design IPs.
More tangible examples include,
microprocessor course,
on-chip memories, PISA interface micro,
fully routed netlist,
Verilog chip descriptions, and so on.
These are also as virtual components,
blocks, cores, or
sometimes called a macros.
Based on their performance and
the flexibility.
Design, design intellectual properties
can be categorized into three groups.
Hard IPs, they include GDSII files with
test the list and high level models,
customer physical layout,
fully placed in a routed netlist for
a given partic, technology library.
These hard IPs have
predictable performance, and
most of the time, optimized.
But they are very, very inflexible.
On the other hand,
soft IPs are delivered in the form of
synthesizable HDL code,
like Verilog or VHDL programs.
They offer great design
flexibilities despite the la,
the last predictable performance.
Examples of Firm IPs
are placed RTL sub-blocks and
the fully place netlist for,
for generic technology library.
They can be, they can be considered as
a compromise of hard IPs and soft IPs.
The driven force behind intellectual
properties is the design productive,
productivity gap.
The gap between what can be built and
what can be designed?
This figure is available from Wikipedia.
It shows the CPU transistor
counts in the past of 40 years,
following the Moore's law.
The Moore's law says,
that the number of transistors on a chip
is doubled every 18 months.
I don't want you to read all the words
in small font in this figure.
What is important is that back,
back in 1971 the Intel 40,
4, 4004 processor has 2300 transistors and
they're 10 micrometer technology.
Now, technology has advanced
to 20 nanometres and
more than processors have
buildings of transistors.
The capacity of si,
silicon has increased for
almost 1 billion times
in the past of 40 years.
But designers ability to
do meaningful design.
With such transistors has not
increased at the same pace.
This creates the design productivity gap.
One of the most effective way to close the
gap is reuse-base, reuse-base the design.
Starting, starting from the mid 1990s.
There are many industry
initiatives on IP reuse.
In the US, there
are Virtual Software Interface Alliance,
also known as VSIA, and Virtual,
Virtual Component Exchange.
At the design and reuse this,
organisation in Europe, Europe.
An IP-Highway is the one in the Asia.
In reuse-base design IPs are developed
not only for use, but also for reuse.
Design engineers are forced
to cooperate and
share their data,
expertise, and experience.
These are details I encourage
to be documented and
made public to make reuse more convenient.
But, at the same time,
these efforts has made IP piracy and
the infringement much easier than ever.
Since the early 1990's
litigation cases and
semiconductor related to IP
infringement have been increased very,
very fast causing an estimated annual
revenue loss of billions of dollars.
The most dangerous threat of IP pi, piracy
came in the form of reverse engineering,
chip overbuilding, and counterfeiting.
Reverse engineering is the process,
where a product is taken apart and
analyzed in order to improve or
duplicate the product.
For hardware design IPs, the cost and
the schemes required for
reverse engineering are much less than
those to develop the original IP.
This gives a taggers incent,
incentive for IP piracy.
Chip overbuilding refers to the scenario,
where our foundering fabricates
more chips than the order.
And then sells those extra copies
to the market to make profits.
Counterfeiting is the case
when a low quality product, or
IP, is manufactured but
is sold as a high quality brand name.
The Virtual Software Interface Alliance
has listed the following four goals for
intellectual property protection.
Number one, enable IP providers to protect
their IPs against unauthorized use.
Number two, protect all types of design
data use to produce and deliver IPs.
Number three, detect use of IPs.
And finally, trace of IPs.
[NOISE] In practice, most design,
design IPs are secured
by deterrents and
the protection mag, mechanisms.
Commonly used the deterrents,
includes patents,
copyrights, contracts, trademarks,
and the trade secrets.
They do not directly provide IP piracy
they do not directly prevent IP piracy.
But rather discourage the misuse of IPs
because the attacker was being caught.
They face lawsuit and
severe penalty to recover
the financial loss of the IP provider.
However, it is the IP provider's task to
identify and report IP infringement and
find the attacker.
Protection mechanisms, on the other hand,
use means such as encryption,
chemicals, obfuscation, and
dedicated hardwares to prevent and
authorize the access to the IP.
Standard encryptions can be
applied to protect these IPs.
For example Both Xilinx and Altera have
offered encryption on their IFPG boards.
Chemicals can also be
integrated into the chip for
a passive protections,
mainly from military devices.
When the surface of the, the chip
is scratched and exposed to the a,
to the air it will damage
the exposed silicon.
And thus, prevents reverse engineering.
Meanwhile, obfuscation method have
been proposed at various design phases
in order to disguise the design and make
reverse engineering much more difficult.
In addition, industry organizations have
been working on establishing standards for
IP reuse and IP protection.
For example, Virtual Socket
Interface Alliance has published
two tagging standards to
protect hard IPs and soft IPs.
Law enforcement is the only means to
get back the revenue lost to IP piracy.
The encryption and
other protection mechanisms make IP piracy
more difficult, and more expensive.
But only the detection schemes
such as digital watermark.
digital fingerprinting, and
integrated circuit metering
can enable IP providers to identify
the occurrence of IP piracy.
This identification will be the first
step towards legal fight against
IP infringement.
We will focus on this message this week.
