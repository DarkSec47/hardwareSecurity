Welcome back.
This week we will first talk
about physical attacks.
From studying various ways of
physical attacks, you will see
the threats from hardware, or,
how to break security from hardware side.
You will also learn some of
the countermeasures to these attacks.
Probably one thing that you may find
a very use for is how industry and
government define and
evaluate the security levels of a product.
Most of the physical attacks
require special skills and
knowledge in addition to sometimes very
expensive equipment and the tools.
However, you do not need to have any
special background to understand most
of these attacks.
Our goal in this lecture is to let
people be aware of these attacks,
not to teach them step by step,
how to do such attacks.
Next week, we will discuss in more
details about side-channel attack,
which is a very powerful physical attack.
Over the years of lecturing on
hardware security, I find it is very
difficult to deliver this part of the
material without a lab for demonstrations.
For this Coursera course,
I will also take away some of the images.
Part of this course is developed based on
a book chapter by Sergei Skorabogatov.
On his web page,
Sergei has also posted his lecture notes
Physical Attacks and Tamper Resistance.
If you are interested in this topic, you
should definitely read this book chapter.
Let's start with the question,
what are the physical attacks?
I cannot give you an accurate definition,
but all the physical attacks have
the following characteristics, or
require the following conditions.
First, to launch a physical attack,
the attacker needs physical
access to the chip, or at least should
be able to contact, to contact,
to connect certain wires in order
to measure the target's signals.
With more and more devices being
connected wirelessly nowadays,
physical attacks without physical access
to the system have also been reported.
For example, acoustic attacks, near field
communication attacks, and some attacks
to the RFID can all be performed close
to the device without touching them.
In addition to the necessary equipment and
the tools, the attacker must
also have the required skills and
the knowledge to perform physical attacks.
The second common thing about
all the physical attacks is
that they all have two phases.
First, the Interaction phase
where the attackers interact with
some physical characteristics
of the device to collect data.
And then, the Exploitation phase,
where the attacker analyze the collected
information to reveal the secret and
break the security.
From this, without discussing
any physical attack in details,
what can we say about physical attack and
hardware security?
First, we can imagine that this requires,
requirements make it
harder to attack the system from
hardware than from software or network.
We have said that Physical attacks
needs Physical access to the system.
And those will most of the time need
Specialized equipment, tools, and
the knowledge to perform the task the,
the attack.
And normally, for software attack or
network attack the, the bar is much lower.
On the other hand, we know that the
attackers loss will always be our gain.
In this content, contexts this
means that with the same costs and
efforts investing on protection from
hardware will most likely make the system
more secure than adding security
from network and software layers.
This is also one of the reasons
why hardware security has gained a lot
of attention in the recent years.
However, the downside of
building security at hard lev,
hardware is that this will also
add another attacking surface.
We have to make sure that
the hardware is secure and trusted.
Which means that we should
consider the vulner,
the vulnerabilities of hardware design and
implementations.
And make sure that the back doors
will not become new threats.
Attackers, not necessarily
who launch physical attacks,
can be categorized into three groups.
Class I, clever outsiders.
These attackers are often
very intelligent, but
they may not have sufficient
knowledge about a system.
They may not have access
to the equipment and
the tools necessary to
break the system either.
Class II, knowledgeable insiders.
These attackers are familiar
with the system, and
have highly sophisticated tools and
equipment to analyze and break the system.
Class III, funded organizations.
They normally have a team of expert,
experts with all the necessary skills,
tools, knowledge, and
equipment to invent new attacks if
necessary to break the target system.
So what are the motivations for
all these kind,
kind of different attackers
to break a system?
There's one single motivation, money.
Actually, this is also the motivation for
almost all the attacks.
Based on how money can be made
from successful physical attacks,
we can further partition the motivation
for physical attacks into several groups.
First, steal money or a service directly.
Example of these type of
physical attacks include,
breaking smart cards and
making bogus deposit, or
breaking the TV set top box to
watch programs without subscribing.
Or, breaking game consoles to
play games without paying.
Second, make profit fits by sailing,
selling or reselling products illegally.
IP piracy, integrated circuits,
overbuilding, and
counterfeiting, are all
examples of this kind.
Third, post their own
sales by interrupting or
damaging the service
provided by the competitors.
For example, an attacker can insert
malicious updates, patches or hardware
tojan to make competitors device or system
malfunction or suffer bad performance.
This will give their own product an end,
an unfair competitive edge.
We have discussed IP protection last week,
and we will cover hardware trojan later.
This week our focus will be on how
physical attacks can break the system.
Particularly cryptosystems to
steal service or money directly.
When we say breaking a system, we do not
mean physically destroying the system.
Instead, the attackers want to learn
information about the system that he
doesn't have ac, the authority to access.
In the case of cryptosystems, such
information could be the secret key, or
the secret data.
In the case of design IP protections,
it would be the design details.
If on further discuss, discussing
physical attacks, we would like to
point out the difference between
Physical Attacks and Cryptanalysis.
They both have the goal
of breaking the security.
However, classic Cryptanalysis
focuses on breaking the cryptosystem
by mathematical analysis of the crypto,
cryptographic algorithms.
It had success in the past, for
example, the birthday attack and
the differential Cryptanalysis.
But now, Cryptanalysis is
becoming harder and harder.
This is because most of the modern
crypto systems are theoretically sound
and unbreakable.
Instead, there may exist flaws in
the implementation of the crypto systems.
Physical attacks attempts to find
such flaws and break the system.
Based on whether the targeted system or
device will be damaged during or
after the attack, Physical Attacks
can be classified in three groups.
Invasive attacks,
this kind of attack requires direct access
to the inside of the chip or device.
Depends on whether after you attack,
the system can be reassembled.
The sys, the,
the attack can be either Reversible,
otherwise it called irreversible.
Apparently, for irreversible attacks,
it cannot be repeated.
Normally, the device will be
damaged after the attack.
Sometimes tamper evidence will be,
will left.
The cost and
required skills to perform invasive attack
varies based on how the attacks will
be performed on what kind of systems.
But normally, the cost and
effort will be very, very high.
The second category is called
a Non-invasive attack.
In this case, the attacker
will interact with the device,
with a chip, with its interface,
such as voltage,
current, clock,
input-output interface, etc.
And such attack can also be Passive or
active.
Depending on whether
the attacker only monitors and
measures this physical measure,
physical characteristics.
Or, the attacker also injects input to the
system to cause the system malfunction.
Normally, such attack will
not damage the device, and
it will not leave any tamper evidence.
Most of these thing, these attack,
have very low cost and can be repeated.
And in the middle,
between invasive attack and
non-invasive attack, there's another
category called semi-invasive attacks.
These attacks, normally they require
access to the surface of the chip.
But they do not need to create
contacts with the internal wires.
And usually did not damage the system, and
depends on how the attacker is performed,
they may or may not leave tamper evidence.
And the cost of this depends
on what kind of surface,
what kind of interact they
will have with the system.
They can be high or low.
But still be definitely much lower than
the very expensive invasive attacks.
And they also require some special skills.
And most of the cyber invasive
attacks they are repeatable.
There are a few ways to
perform physical attacks.
And based on how physical
attacks are performed,
it can also be put into
several different categories.
Reverse engineering, this type of
attack will study the chip's in,
inside structure.
Then trying to decide,
determine the functionality of the system.
Normally, this has very high cost, and
the attacker should have similar
capabilities of the designer.
And normally have,
also have the capability of manufacturing.
And this is in general is in,
invasive attack.
The second group is called Microprobing.
In this case it requires to direct
access to the chip surface to observe,
manipulate, and interact with the chip,
and they are also invasive attacks.
The third category is
called a Fault generation.
In this case,
the attacker will generate, create f,
Fault, normally a faulty input,
or make the chip run eh,
of normal environment conditions, and in
the hope that the chip will malfunction,
to leak information, or give the attacker
additional access to the system.
Depending how the fault is generated,
the attack can be either be
semi-invasive or non-invasive.
And Side-channel attack,
which we'll discuss next week,
they are normally non-invasive attacks,
and this type of attack has two phases.
First, the attacker, while monitoring,
will measure a chip's physical
characteristics, such as power, current,
timing, EM radiation, etc,
during the chip's normal operation mode.
And then, with the data collected,
they will perform a data analysis
to learn the hidden information.
And finally,
there's a category called Software attack.
This again, it is non-invasive and
the attacker will use normal input,
output interface trying to explore known
security vulnerabilities in the se,
in the security protocols or
algorithms were there software
implementations to perform an attack.
This attack, they are repeatable and
non-invasive.
