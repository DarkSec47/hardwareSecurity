Welcome back, everyone.
This is the last week of the course.
We will cover some good
practice in security design and
emergent hardware security topics.
We will talk about the Trusted
platform module or
TPM with focus on its crypto-key
generation and the management structure.
Then we will learn the basic concepts
of physical unclonable function.
We will discuss
the vulnerabilities attached and
the counter measures in FPGA design and
FPGA-based assistance.
We will conclude week, and the course
with a brief overview of the role
that hardware plays in security and trust.
We will need some basic
knowledge of digital logic
design to understand the physical and
global function.
As revealed on physical attacks,
IP protections, and hardware Trojan will
be helpful for the materials related
to the FPGA system security.
Trust Platform Module or
TPM in short refers to
both the set of specifications for
a secure crypto-processor.
And the implementation of these
specifications on a chip.
We will focus our discussion
on the TPS chips.
The specifications can be found in the
webpage of the Trusted Computing Group.
TPM chips can being stored
on the motherboard and
is used in almost all of the PCs,
laptops, and smartphones.
It is suggested to use TPM
together with firewalls,
antivirus software, smart card and
biometric verification.
Many companies are making
their own TPM chips.
A TPM chip's main function include
secure generation of cryptographic keys,
protection of these keys,
generating pseudo-random numbers.
Hardware authentication,
sealed storage of password
keys and a digital certificates,
and remote attestation.
Remote attestation allows changes
to the user's computer to
be detected by authorized parties.
TPM has many types of keys.
Among them, the Endorsement Key is
perhaps the most important one.
This is a RSA public private key pair.
It is created only once to
the lifetime of the TPM.
Normally, it is generated by
the TPM manufacturer after the TPM
chip is fabricated and tested.
The private key is stored
inside the TPM and
can be used internally for a decryption.
It will never be revealed or
as, accessed outside the P, TPM.
The storage's root key or SRK is another
important key stored inside the TPM.
It is created when the TPM's
ownership is created.
The TPM's endorsement key and
the user's specified password
will be used to generate the SRK.
The attestation iden, identify key or
AIK is an another RSA key pair
designed for attestation.
The public key will be designed,
will be signed by the endorsement key.
Then it will be said, sent to a trusted
certificate authority or known as CA.
The CA will validate the endorsement
key and issue a certificate for
the test, for
the attestation identity key.
TPM will authenticate itself
using this certificate.
This is the start after
direct anonymous attestation.
Storage key are asymmetric keys used for
encrypting data or other keys.
This encryption process is sometimes
referred, referred to as wrapping.
Signing keys are general
purpose keys used to,
to sign, and to sign applications,
data or messages.
Binder keys are used to encrypt
a small amount of data or
key on one platform and
to decrypt it on another platform.
Authentication keys
are symmetric keys used,
used to protect transport
sessions involving the TPM.
Legacy keys are keys which can
be exported to another TPM
after creation and may be used for
signing and encryption operations.
They are referenced to specific users and
their application fields.
Based on whether a key can be
transferred from one TPM to another,
the TPM keys will have,
will have one of the following attributes.
The non-migrate, migratable keys,
or NMK, are those created for
one TPM and cannot be migrated or
exported to another TPM.
They are stored in TPMs
shielded locations,.
And then, the TPM can create
certificate for non-migratable keys.
Migratable keys or MK are the keys that
are not generated for a specific TPM.
They can be generated either inside or
outside a TPM.
They can be integrated inside a TPM or
moved from one TPM to another one.
Migratable keys are only trusted
by the party who generate them.
Certified Migratable keys or
CMK are generated inside a TPM
like a non-migratable keys.
But they can been migrated to another TPM.
At the time when they are created,
the creator has to pick up a migration
authority, or MA, or
migration selection authority, or MSA.
Which will have the authority
to migrate to the key.
CMK's can both be migrated and also be
considered secure as long as the MSA,
and, the MA's to migrate
the keys are trusted.
Here are some advantages and
disadvantages of using TPM.
Using TPM it will add security against
the physical threat and attacks.
It can also give you the convenience
with the single sign-on feature.
However, there are also a couple
of concerns of using TPM.
First, it's the biggest concern,
is about user privacy.
With all the user data stored off TPM,
once the TPM is compromised,
user sensitive data will be lost.
And second, as we have mentioned,
there are many many TPM vendors.
How can we trust this
hardware design process, and
how can we trust these vendors?
That is under the counsel.
So here, there are some useful
links about the the TPM.
We give the [INAUDIBLE] homepage
of the Trusted Computing Group.
And how to use TPM with Linux and
the TPM and
the BitLocker in Windows
8 Operating System.
Finally, besides TPM,
there are many good secure design practice
from most of the leading companies.
Such as AMD, Cisco, HP, IBM, Intel,
as well as the major FPJ vendors,
such as Altara and Zynex.
I'm not going to do a commercial for
any of them, if you are interested you
can easily find them from their web page.
On how they can do secure system design.
